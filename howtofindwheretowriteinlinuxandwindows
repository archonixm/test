File transfer methods — Linux

Once you’ve got command execution, there’s a good chance you will want to transfer files to the victim box.

First things first — you need to find a directory you can write to. The first places to look are /tmp or /dev/shm but if that doesn’t work for you, this command should find writeable directories:

find / -type d \( -perm -g+w -or -perm -o+w \) -exec ls -adl {} \;


finding writeable files in windows
dir /a-r-d /s /b

dir /a-r-d /s /b >writeablefiles.txt

Writable directory
Get-ChildItem C:\temp\ -Recurse | Get-Acl | grep "Everyone"

OR

Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Get-Acl | out-string -stream | select-string -pattern "everyone"
